## Description
This silly program seems to use a periodic timer to change buzzer frequency and blink the green LED.

## Exploration
_Incorporate the button:_ Maybe borrow some code from button_demo so
that your program can respond to button presses. Initially do
something simple like have it turn on the red led. Later have buttons
select modes, for example, changing the rate that sounds change and/or
the blink pattern.

_Play Music:_ Maybe store a sequence of notes in an an array, and
play it through the buzzer. Maybe use buttons to select different
songs?
